  I was born and raised in the cool and flowery city of Baguio in the Philippines. After drawing lots from a bible to decide on a college (Long story!), I moved to the Metro Manila region to study at Ateneo de Manila University, where I worked on degrees in applied physics and computer science.
  
  A year into struggling with physics and writing code, my parents told me that we were moving to the United States. I took this as an exciting sign to leave writing code behind. I changed majors and studied psychology and philosophy at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/), where I ran the gamut doing research on metacognition, stress, self-control, and aggression. It was not until I had the fantastic fortune of working with [Fernanda Ferreira](https://ferreiralab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) on exploring individual differences in resolving ambiguous relative clauses that I realized I really wanted to study things related to language processing.
  
  With that fire in my belly, I went straight from undergrad to work on my PhD in cognitive psychology at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://psychology.unc.edu/). I worked with [Peter Gordon](https://petercgordon.web.unc.edu/) on measurement and methodological issues in psycholinguistics. Joke's on me because writing code takes up most of my work now, so it really came full circle.
  
  During my time as a PhD student, I was also a researcher in the Natural Language Processing group at Educational Testing Service, supervised by Beata Beigman Klebanov and Anastassia Loukina. I worked on [*RelayReader*&trade;](https://relayreader.org/), a reading tutor app for developing readers that emulates the kind of turn-taking that caretakers do with children.
  
  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Peabody College at Vanderbilt University working with [Duane Watson](http://www.duanegwatson.com/) and [Emily Phillips-Galloway](https://www.emilyphillipsgalloway.com/) on novel measures of language exposure, evaluating the psychometric properties of various psycholinguistic measures, and modeling individual differences in language processing.
  
  I am the first person in my family to get a PhD, and together with all other aspects of my identity, I am acutely cognizant of the challenges and lucky breaks that went with my specific experience. This drives my passion for promoting inclusive teaching and mentorship practices. I am committed to cultivating an equitable intellectual climate, where the contributions and perspectives of marginalized and underrepresented communities are sought, respected, and valued.
  
  Outside of work, I love playing board games, strategy-based video games, karaoke, and watching reruns of The Great British Baking Show.
